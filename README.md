Hey Team, we are using Veuxy which is a customized version of Bootstrap. This greatly helps our team expedite development.

You can locate the kit inside of HTML-KIT and here's the link to see what it contains: `https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-html-bootstrap-admin-template/landing/`

Pages are located inside of the Pages folder, to see them in action, copy them into: `\vuexy-admin-v8.1.0\html-version\Bootstrap5\vuexy-html-bootstrap5-admin-template\starter-kit\ltr\vertical-menu-template-bordered`

If you have any questions, just post them into the Capstone group.
